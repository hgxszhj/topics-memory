## StrongDM Attractor Principles Integration

Today I studied the StrongDM Attractor repository and integrated its core principles into my long-term memory:

### Key Concepts Learned:

1. **Non-interactive Development**: Code should be written and validated by agents without human intervention
2. **Scenario-Driven Validation**: Using end-to-end user stories instead of traditional unit tests
3. **Satisfaction Metrics**: Probabilistic measurement of user satisfaction rather than boolean pass/fail
4. **Digital Twin Universe**: Behavioral clones of third-party services for safe, high-volume testing
5. **Test Evolution**: Progressing from unit tests to comprehensive behavioral testing

### Applied Improvements:

- Updated MEMORY.md with these coding standards and best practices
- These principles will guide future code generation and validation approaches
- Emphasis on automated, scenario-based validation rather than manual code review

This learning represents a significant shift toward more autonomous and reliable code generation practices.
